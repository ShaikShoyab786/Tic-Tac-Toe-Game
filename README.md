## 🧠 Minimax Algorithm (AI Explanation)

The Minimax AI evaluates every possible future game state and makes the move that guarantees the best outcome for the computer.  

- AI = Maximizer  
- Human = Minimizer  
- Recursively checks all moves  
- Ensures the AI never loses  

This makes the **Hard Mode AI completely perfect**.
